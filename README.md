 Student Depression Analysis Using Data Science
1.  Overview
Mental health challenges among university students are becoming increasingly common, with depression standing out as one of the most widespread and impactful disorders. It can negatively affect:
1)Academic performance
2)Social relationships
3)General well-being

This project leverages data science techniques to analyze and predict student depression by uncovering key risk factors and patterns. Through the use of machine learning, statistics, and data visualization, it supports educational institutions in designing better mental health strategies.

2.  Objectives
2.1 Data Collection & Analysis
Gather public or survey-based datasets related to student mental health
Clean and preprocess the data to ensure consistency
Explore the dataset through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

2.2 Identifying Risk Factors
Analyze connections between academic, social, and personal variables
Use statistical analysis and feature selection to highlight significant predictors

2.3 Machine Learning for Prediction
Build predictive models to classify students into:
1)Depressed 
2)not Depressed

Compare the performance of models like:
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
lightGBM
XGB
Neural Networks
SVM
GradientBoosting
KNN

2.4 Data Visualization & Reporting
Use tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn,and Power BI
Create interactive dashboards and clear visual summaries
Provide practical recommendations based on data insights

3.  Scope
 Included
Public dataset collection and preparation
Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Machine learning model development
Visual presentation of findings

 Excluded
Real-time diagnosis or clinical recommendations
Clinical assessment data (unless publicly available)
Psychological counseling or direct mental health services

4.  Technologies Used
Category	Tools / Libraries
Programming Language	Python
Data Analysis	pandas, NumPy
Machine Learning	scikit-learn, 
Visualization	Matplotlib, Seaborn,Power BI

5.  Expected Outcomes
Identification of key factors linked to student depression
Clear classification of students into risk levels
Dashboards and visuals to help universities make informed decisions
Data-backed recommendations to support mental health programs

6. Outcome
This project provides a data-driven understanding of depression among students. The insights gained can assist academic institutions in identifying at-risk individuals and designing preventive mental health programs. While it is not a substitute for medical advice, the analysis offers a valuable foundation for further research and intervention planning.
