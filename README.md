# Student Depression Analysis Using Data Science
This project aims to develop a predictive model to identify university students at risk of depression using psychological, academic, and lifestyle factors. The goal is to provide educational institutions with data-driven insights to support mental health strategies and early intervention efforts.

## 1. Project Overview
University students face increasing mental health challenges, with depression being one of the most widespread disorders. This project leverages data science techniques to:

- Identify critical risk factors for student depression

- Build machine learning models to classify students by risk level

- Offer actionable insights for improving campus mental health services

## 3. Dataset Description
Source: Kaggle (after over a month of exploration)

The dataset includes a wide variety of features categorized into:

1. Personal Information
ID, gender, age, city, pet ownership, favorite color

2. Academic Factors
Academic pressure, CGPA, degree, study satisfaction, study/work hours

3. Psychological Factors
Suicidal thoughts, depression status, PHQ-9 score, cortisol level

4. Social & Emotional Factors
Financial stress, family history of mental illness, social isolation, bullying, family issues, uncertain future, social media usage

5. Lifestyle & Health Habits
Sleep duration, dietary habits, drug/smoking, daily coffee intake, music genre preference


2.1 Data Collection & Analysis
Gather public or survey-based datasets related to student mental health
Clean and preprocess the data to ensure consistency
Explore the dataset through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

2.2 Identifying Risk Factors
Analyze connections between academic, social, and personal variables
Use statistical analysis and feature selection to highlight significant predictors

2.3 Machine Learning for Prediction
Build predictive models to classify students into:
1)Depressed 
2)not Depressed

Compare the performance of models like:
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
lightGBM
XGB
Neural Networks
SVM
GradientBoosting
KNN

2.4 Data Visualization & Reporting
Use tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn,and Power BI
Create interactive dashboards and clear visual summaries
Provide practical recommendations based on data insights

5.  Expected Outcomes
Identification of key factors linked to student depression
Clear classification of students into risk levels
Dashboards and visuals to help universities make informed decisions
Data-backed recommendations to support mental health programs

6. Outcome
This project provides a data-driven understanding of depression among students. The insights gained can assist academic institutions in identifying at-risk individuals and designing preventive mental health programs. While it is not a substitute for medical advice, the analysis offers a valuable foundation for further research and intervention planning.
