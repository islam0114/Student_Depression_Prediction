Student Depression Analysis Using Data Science
Overview
Mental health challenges among university students have become increasingly common, with depression ranking among the most serious issues. It affects studentsâ€™ academic performance, social life, and general well-being.
This project applies data science techniques to explore and understand the underlying factors behind student depression. By using machine learning, statistical analysis, and data visualization, the project aims to identify high-risk groups and support the development of more effective mental health strategies in educational institutions.

Objectives
The project is structured around four main goals:

Data Collection & Analysis

Collect relevant datasets from public sources or surveys focused on student mental health.

Clean and preprocess the data to ensure consistency and reliability.

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends, anomalies, and correlations.

Identifying Risk Factors

Examine the relationship between academic, social, and personal factors and the likelihood of depression.

Apply statistical techniques and feature selection methods to determine key predictors.

Machine Learning for Risk Prediction

Develop and train machine learning models to classify students into depression risk categories (e.g., low, moderate, high).

Evaluate and compare the performance of different algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.

Data Visualization & Reporting

Present the findings using clear and interactive visualizations through tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau, or Power BI.

Summarize results in a comprehensive report with practical recommendations for universities and mental health professionals.

Project Scope
Included:
Collection and processing of data from online sources, research studies, or surveys.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand key variables.

Development and evaluation of machine learning models for depression risk prediction.

Data visualization and interactive dashboards for clear communication of insights.

Excluded:
Clinical diagnosis or mental health treatment.

Data collection through clinical interviews or private health records.

Any form of psychological therapy or direct engagement with students.

Technologies & Tools
Programming Language: Python

Libraries: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Visualization Tools: Tableau, Power BI (for interactive dashboards)

Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Neural Networks

Outcome
This project provides a data-driven understanding of depression among students. The insights gained can assist academic institutions in identifying at-risk individuals and designing preventive mental health programs. While it is not a substitute for medical advice, the analysis offers a valuable foundation for further research and intervention planning.
