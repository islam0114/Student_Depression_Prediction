OUR PROJECT :

Overview: 
Mental health issues among students have become a growing concern, with depression 
being one of the most prevalent disorders affecting academic performance, social 
relationships, and overall well-being. This project utilizes data science techniques to 
analyze student depression by identifying key risk factors and patterns that contribute to 
mental health struggles. 
By leveraging machine learning models, statistical analysis, and data visualization, this 
project aims to uncover insights that can aid universities, educators, and mental health 
professionals in designing better intervention strategies. The analysis will provide a data
driven approach to understanding student depression and identifying the most vulnerable 
groups.

Objectives: 
The primary objectives of this project include: 
• Data Collection & Analysis 
   o Gather real or publicly available datasets on student mental health. 
   o Clean, preprocess, and explore the dataset to find patterns. 
• Identifying Risk Factors 
   o Analyze relationships between academic, social, and personal factors that 
     contribute to depression. 
   o Determine key predictors using statistical analysis and feature selection 
techniques. 
• Machine Learning for Prediction 
   o Develop predictive models to classify students into different risk categories 
     (e.g., low, moderate, high risk). 
   o Compare different ML models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, 
      Random Forest, Neural Networks) for accuracy. 
 
• Data Visualization & Reporting 
   o Create interactive dashboards and graphs to present insights in a 
      meaningful way. 
   o Provide recommendations based on findings to help institutions implement 
      mental health programs. 
 
Scope: 
• Included in the Project 
   o Data collection and preprocessing from surveys, research papers, or online 
     datasets. 
   o  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends and correlations. 
   o  Development of machine learning models for predicting depression risk. 
   o  Visualization of findings using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and interactive tools like 
       Tableau/Power BI. 
• Excluded from the Project 
   o Real-time medical diagnosis or treatment recommendations. 
   o Data collection through clinical assessments (unless publicly available). 
   o Psychological counseling or direct student interventions.
